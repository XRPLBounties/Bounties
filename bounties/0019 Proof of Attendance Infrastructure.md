# Proof of Attendance Infrastructure

## Overview

Community Event Management Tool: Build a library to provide infrastructure that allows event organizers to mint and distribute Attendance NFTs on the XRP Ledger.

## Details

Create an API library that enables event organizers/developers in the XRPL community to distribute digital badges/collectibles NFTs minted on the XRPL Ledger using XLS-20(https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/46) for their events.
XLS-20 (native support for NFTs) is implemented in xrpl.js (https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js) and xrpl.py (https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-py) and currently live on NFT testnet.

See similar infrastructure built on Ethereum https://poap.xyz/#

Basic requirements:

1. Given a minter - able to mint NFTs for all attendees with the same metadata and artwork (artwork should be hosted somewhere that's not XRPL).
   The NFT minted should include a memo/taxon field that include information about the event (date, location and description) and an artwork that represents the event.
2. Provide a gateway for attendees to collect the NFTs through their wallets or creating new wallets and distributing them securely.
