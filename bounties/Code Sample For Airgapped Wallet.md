**Requirement**: This project must be reviewed and merged into xrpl.org's repo under the code sample directory @ https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/tree/master/content/_code-samples

The value of the proposal is determined by the amount of research and development put in place, researching & developing the code sample takes a considerable amount of time since the airgapped wallet's effectiveness is not determined by the code itself (to secure the keypair), it's the design and security practices behind the concept which gatekeeps the keypair without any way of compromising it.

Simplifying this to new developers on the ecosystem will give them a sense of why security is prioritized in applications which hold custody to cryptocurrencies & assets. 

All milestones on this Bounty must be fully reached with synchronization  since with one single feature missing (aka. 1 milestone not being accomplished), it won't work as an airgapped wallet requires all the proposed mechanics to work together:
1. Generate wallet and store securely (using cryptography in this case)
2. Sign a transaction and keep the fields complete (i.e. the last ledger sequence is high enough to keep up with ledger progress [+100 advancement])
3. Transmit the signed transaction blob in a secure channel *without* compromising or connecting the airgapped machine to a network (i.e using a QR code)
4. Relay the transaction to a rippled node and display the results

### Milestone 1 Details
>store it securely with a password feature built-in using a cryptography algorithm

Encrypting the keypair on the filesystem should look like this, where the password is used as a key to encrypt/decrypt the wallet creds:
```py
        kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
            algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
            length=32,
            iterations=100000,
            salt=salt
        )

        key = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(bytes(password.encode())))

        crypt = Fernet(key)

        priv = crypt.encrypt(bytes(seed, encoding='utf-8'))
        seed = crypt.encrypt(bytes(seed, encoding='utf-8'))

        with open(get_path("/Wallet/seed.txt"), "w") as f:
            f.write(seed.hex())

        with open(get_path("/Wallet/private.txt"), "w") as f:
            f.write(priv.hex())
```


### Milestone 3 Details
>**Efficiently** & **Securely** transfer a signed transaction blob

By "securely", do not compromise the airgapped machine with any unreliable channels which includes wired, bluetooth, or local network solutions.

It is best to use a QR code solution as it only transfers the necessary information from the airgapped machine to the outside party.

Example:

(Scan me, it's just a signed_tx blob)
