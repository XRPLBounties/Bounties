# JavaScript Code Samples

## Overview

The XRP Ledger Dev Portal contains many [code samples](https://xrpl.org/code-samples.html), but some of them are not available in JavaScript. Developers would benefit from additional relevant, high quality, well-documented examples in JavaScript.

## Details

To add missing code samples, follow the instructions at the bottom of the page, under **Contribute Code Samples**.

https://xrpl.org/code-samples.html

## Milestones

| # | Description | Details | Proposed Potential Award | Completed? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Cryptographic Key Derivation](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/tree/master/content/_code-samples/key-derivation) | Derive secp256k1 or Ed25519 key pairs from seeds in any of the XRP Ledger's encodings and formats. This sample can be pulled out of, or perhaps implemented within, an existing client library. | $1,000 | COMPLETED |
| 2 | [Transaction Serialization](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/tree/master/content/_code-samples/tx-serialization) |  This sample can be pulled out of, or perhaps implemented within, an existing client library. | $1,000 | OPEN |

When creating a PR to add these code samples please include a link to this document: 
https://github.com/XRPLBounties/Proposals/blob/main/bounties/0031%20JavaScript%20Code%20Samples.md

➡️ A milestone is complete only after the relevant code sample has been approved, merged, and deployed onto XRPL.org.
- All of these code samples must have feature parity with the existing equivalent code samples in other languages. 
- They must also be well-documented to be a useful learning reference, not just working code which performs the task.
