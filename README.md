# XRPL Bounties Is Officially Sunset

XRPL Bounties was an experiment to encourage community members to tackle important and challenging problems, and to help them feel comfortable contributing to open source projects in the XRPL ecosystem. Weâ€™re winding down the program in order to refocus on the [XRPL Grants](https://xrplgrants.org/) and [XRPL Accelerator](https://xrplaccelerator.org/) programs. For developers requiring funding, these programs continue to help the community build impactful projects.

Work that is still in development will continue to be reviewed and paid out according to the milestones set previously. All bounties which have not been picked up are now closed though, and no new bounties will be created. 

With XRPL Bounties, the community was able to build a lot of useful code. For example, they wrote extensive code samples to improve the [xrpl.org](https://xrpl.org/) docs and created several in-depth tutorials. Developers also delivered a Shopify app prototype, which is now being turned into a full Shopify app by the Amora team through XRPL Grants. We were glad to be able to reward developers for their work on those contributions.

Note to avoid confusion: There is a separate [Bug Bounty](https://ripple.com/legal/bug-bounty/) program which is still ongoing for the community to responsibly report bugs or issues they discover relating to the ledger.

# Bounty Submission

## Contributing to existing open source projects

To submit your bounty work to an existing open source repository (e.g. for contributions to [xrpl.org](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal)), please follow the corresponding repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructions to create a pull request for maintainers to review.

## Contributing to new bounty projects (open source)

To submit your bounty work for review (whether finished or a work-in-progress), you must open a Pull Request against the corresponding `XRPLBounties` repository. This should be linked from the bounty, and can also be found by searching the [XRPL Bounties GitHub organization](https://github.com/XRPLBounties).

This will allow reviewers to directly comment on specific lines of code, clearly indicate when a bounty is accepted, and help increase the publicity for your work. The community will be able to find everything under the [XRPL Bounties GitHub organization](https://github.com/XRPLBounties).
