# Tutorial for Send a Cross-Currency Payment
Bounty proposals require 3+ technical approvals _and_ budget approval before they are available to be worked on. A proposal PR with 3+ âœ…s is not fully approved if it has not been merged. The bounty is only ready to be worked on after the PR has been merged.

## Overview

### High Level Description
Build a tutorial for sending a cross-currency payment on xrpl.org, reference issues [here](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/issues/1198)

### requirements
1. Write a tutorial with quality code samples in JavaScript that shows steps to send a cross-currency payment, including: 
    - [ ] Pathfinding.
    - [ ] Setting reasonable `SendMax` values
    - [ ] Have to pay for any transfer fees plus the spread on Offers
    - [ ] Choose between multiple source currencies based on cost/liquidity
    - [ ] Troubleshooting (`tecPATH_DRY` / `tecPATH_PARTIAL` in particular)
    - [ ] using `DeliverMin` and partial payments to achieve a "fixed sending amount" cross-currency payment (rather than the default, "fixed receiving amount" payment)
