# JavaScript Code Samples 2

## This will not be merged until we receive budget approval even if we get 3+ technical approvals. Once merged, this bounty is ready to be worked on, please hold off starting work till merging. ##

## Overview

Currently, our JavaScript documentations have [code snippets](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js/tree/main/packages/xrpl/snippets/src) and [code samples](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/tree/master/content/_code-samples) for some common usecases. However, there needs to be more examples to capture common tasks that users would want the library to do, and fixes to outdated or misconfigured snippets. Developers would benefit from additional relevant, high quality, well-documented examples in JavaScript.

When submitting a PR completing one of these milestones, please link to this markdown file for the bounty:

- A milestone is complete only after the relevant code sample has been approved, merged, and deployed onto XRPL.org.
- All of these code samples must have feature parity with the existing equivalent code samples in other languages.
- They must also be well-documented to be a useful learning reference, not just working code which performs the task.
