## Overview

<!--
Please provide the context required to complete the bounty.

Questions you should answer here:
1. What is the high level explanation of this bounty? (1-3 sentences)
2. What problem is this solving?
3. What are the requirements for this solution?
-->

Xrpl.js currently allows you to subscribe to ledger updates ([as specified here](https://xrpl.org/subscribe.html)) - it'd be useful to allow that in xrpl-py as well.

This would involve creating an event handler which allows you to subscribe to multiple non-admin subscriptions (So you would NOT have to implement `.on(peer_status)` for example).

[This issue](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-py/issues/290) has a lot of context, including a couple examples of how this could be implemented.

The final submission would have to be well-tested to be production ready.

## Milestones

<!--
Please split the bounty into smaller milestones with individual awards in the following template.
The first milestone should be the core functionality, while the rest can be useful add-ons.

| # | High-Level Description | Details | Proposed Potential Award |
| 1 | Make & test the event handler | Implement `.on(event_type, callback)`, `.off(callback)` to remove a callback, and `.request(cmd, callback)` as specified in [this issue](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-py/issues/290) | $2500 |
