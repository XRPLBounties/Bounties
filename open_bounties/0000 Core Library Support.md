# Core Library Support

**Category: Open Source Tooling**

<!--
Recommend a total value amount for the bounty, in U.S. Dollars. The exact amount will be determined by the approving committee and may be higher or lower than this recommendation.
-->

**Amount:** $250 - $1000+ per bounty

## Overview

<!--
Please provide the context required to complete the bounty.
Questions you should answer here:
1. What is the high level explanation of this bounty? (1-3 sentences)
2. What problem is this solving?
3. What are the requirements for this solution?
-->

For core XRPL libraries such as xrpl.js, xrpl-py, rippled, and the explorer, there may be issues which make for good bounties.

Those issues should also be tagged with "Approved Bounty" once they are listed here.

These tasks generally take at least a day of coding, are reasonable to build on your own, and are a way to learn about
a specific piece of the XRPL ecosystem.

In order to complete the bounty, your PR must include unit tests, be well documented, update the CHANGELOG.md / HISTORY.md file and be merged in to the corresponding repository.

This is a purpetual bounty - so as new issues are discovered we will continue to add milestones here.

## Milestones

<!--
Please split the bounty into smaller milestones with individual awards in the following template.
The first milestone should be the core functionality, while the rest can be useful add-ons.
| # | High-Level Description | Details | Proposed Potential Award |
| 1 | ... | ... | $... |
(The proposed amounts from milestones should add up to the amount listed at the top of the bounty proposal)
-->
