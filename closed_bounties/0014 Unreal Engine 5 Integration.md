# Unreal Engine 5 Integration

## High Level Description

Description: Build a code-plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that allows game developers to make payments using the XRPL, and trade NFTs.

### Full Description

This proposal would require you to create an open source plug-in that anyone using Unreal Engine could use to add XRPL payments to their game.

As part of that, you would have to:

1. Build out the functionality for game developers to allow users to send payments on the XRPL (Potentially using Xumm’s QR code method of signing transactions) Note: If you are signing transactions for players, the mechanism for signing transactions must be highly secure.
2. Add integration with NFT transactions as part of XLS-20 on the test networks, allowing minting, burning, buying, and selling of NFTs
3. Add it as a free “Code Plug-In” on the [Unreal Engine Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/content-cat/assets/codeplugins?count=20&sortBy=effectiveDate&sortDir=DESC&start=0)
4. Create documentation that helps game developers understand how to use the plug in as part of their games.

Beyond that, other milestones involve adding additional features to allow game developers to have more access to the XRPL.

| # | High-Level Description | Details | Proposed Potential Award |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Basic Plug-In | Create a free, well-documented “Code Plug-In” on the Unreal Engine Marketplace that meets the 4 requirements above. | $2,000 |
| 2 | Proof of Concept | Create an example game which allows for payments as an example for other developers | $1,000 |

[^1]: In review means we have a received a submission for this milestone which is still in consideration, but we are providing feedback to. This does not mean they will necessary be awarded the milestone, but they do have existing work.
