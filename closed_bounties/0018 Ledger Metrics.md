# Ledger Metrics

## Overview
When viewing a particular ledger (e.g. [Ledger Page](https://livenet.xrpl.org/ledgers/69537171)) in addition to showing a table of transaction a collection of metrics for the ledger should be show.

## Details
The following metrics should be shown above the transaction table and accompanied with `95%` code coverage.

- Current stats
	- Number of transactions (currently shown)
	- Total Fees (currently shown)
- Milestone 1 Stats
	- Number of successful transactions
	- Number of failed transactions (tec*)
	- Breakdown of transactions by type (DEX, Payments, Account, NFT, XChain)
	- A special call-out (icon) if there are no `tecINVARIANT_FAILED` transactions
- Milestone 2 Stats
	- Summaries of the amount of [ledger objects by type](https://xrpl.org/ledger-object-types.html): AccountRoot (account), Offer, Escrow, RippleState (trust line), PayChannel, etc.
	
### Proposed Visuals
The new data should follow the design below.  It shows what it would look like with the current metrics.  The new metrics would use the same styling
